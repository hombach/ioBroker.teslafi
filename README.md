## Adapter to poll TeslaFi data of your car

This adapter facilitates the connection of data from your TeslaFi account's API to be used within ioBroker.

## Developer manual

This section is intended for the developer. It can be deleted later.

### Best Practices

We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Scripts in `package.json`

Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `build` | Compile the TypeScript sources. |
| `watch` | Compile the TypeScript sources and watch for changes. |
| `test:ts` | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.ts` files. |
| `test:package` | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test:integration` | Tests the adapter startup with an actual instance of ioBroker. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `check` | Performs a type-check on your code (without compiling anything). |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |
| `translate` | Translates texts in your adapter to all required languages, see [`@iobroker/adapter-dev`](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#manage-translations) for more details. |

### Configuring the compilation

The adapter template uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to compile TypeScript and/or React code. You can configure many compilation settings
either in `tsconfig.json` or by changing options for the build tasks. These options are described in detail in the
[`@iobroker/adapter-dev` documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#compile-adapter-files).

### Writing tests

When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92.
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.

### Publishing the adapter

Using GitHub Actions, you can enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. We **strongly recommend** that you do. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

To get your adapter released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).

### Test the adapter manually with dev-server

Please use `dev-server` to test and debug your adapter.

You may install and start `dev-server` by calling from your dev directory:

```bash
npm install --global @iobroker/dev-server
dev-server setup
dev-server watch
```

Please refer to the [`dev-server` documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/dev-server#readme) for more details.

## Sentry

This adapter employs Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers. For more details and information on how to disable error reporting, please consult the [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is initiated starting with js-controller 3.0.
